# What is Decision Tree ?
A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression modeling. Regression is a method used for predictive modeling, so these trees are used to either classify data or predict what will come next. 

Decision trees look like flowcharts, starting at the root node with a specific question of data, that leads to branches that hold potential answers. The branches then lead to decision (internal) nodes. This goes on until the data reaches what’s called a terminal (or “leaf”) node and ends.

# 1. Classification trees
Classification trees determine whether an event happened or didn’t happen. Usually, this involves a “yes” or “no” outcome. 

# 2. Regression trees
Regression trees, on the other hand, predict continuous values based on previous data or information sources. This type of decision-making is more about programming algorithms to predict what is likely to happen, given previous behavior or trends. 

# Example - 
Suppose there is a candidate who has a job offer and wants to decide whether he should accept the offer or Not. So, to solve this problem, the decision tree starts with the root node. Consider the below diagram:
